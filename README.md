# portfolio

This is my portfolio made in React

It's structured around a .yaml config file and .mdx content files, with a recursively
generated navigation list, allowing me to nest as deeply as I'd like in the config.

I've really enjoyed working with MDX; it combines the ease of writing from markdown
with the customizability of React components. I feel confident in my ability to quickly
make changes to the content of my site.
