# My React Games

Here are some games I've made in React while learning:

<CardBox>
  <ImgCard
    href="https://contrick-tenzies.netlify.com"
    imgSrc={tenzies}
    title="Tenzies"
    text="A game about rolling dice"
  />
  <ImgCard
    href="https://contrick-quizzical.netlify.com"
    imgSrc={quizzical}
    title="Quizzical"
    text="A game about quiz"
  />
</CardBox>
