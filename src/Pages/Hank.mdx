# Hank Display Typeface

In Typeface Design, I studied under professor Don Tarallo 
at Fitchburg State, and spent an entire semester working
through the system of characters, adjusting each one to
match the rest, and making sure each change fit the feeling
of the typeface overall. Hank was designed to be macho,
somewhat comedic, and very heavy.

This is a promotional poster designed for my typeface Hank.
The text reads ```“Hank waltzes onto the page with an oafish
pride unmet by any other typeface. Hank commands the space
it's in, acting as more than just text. Hank creates a
strong shape, and an instantly recognizable silhouette. A
header typed in Hank is an uber-confident, in-your-face
header, one that grabs you by the shoulders and says READ ME!”```
