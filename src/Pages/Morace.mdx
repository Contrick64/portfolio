# M.O.R.A.C.E. website

[https://moracethechat.com](https://moracethechat.com)

This is a website I made in PHP (and possibly the last PHP site
I will make). It uses a MySQL database to access the data for each
of the releases we have put out through our label.

My favorite part of the site is the animated ASCII cat, which changes
its keyframe as you click around.

Also, if you're up for some easter egg hunting, try inputting a famous
cheat code on the home page...
