# M.O.R.A.C.E. website
---

[https://moracethechat.com](https://moracethechat.com)

This is a website I made using **PHP** to query a **MySQL** database and list
out the contents. It then queries the database whenever you click on
a release, and shows you some of the details of that release.

## Challenges

I'm planning to remake this site using React. After spending a lot of time
in this project learning the limitations of PHP, especially in terms of
security, I feel that there is a lot to improve. I'd like to bring
this site up to date with my current workflow, and use it to learn about
interacting with a **relational database** in React.

## Fun Stuff

My favorite part of the site is the animated ASCII art cat, which changes
its keyframe as you click around. I liked it so much that I recreated it
for my portfolio. You can check it out on the <a href='/' target='_self'>
homepage</a> if you missed it!

Also, if you're up for some easter egg hunting, try inputting a certain
famous video game cheat code on the M.O.R.A.C.E. home page...
