# Hand-Coded React Portfolio

Recursion? Yes.

This website is all about recursion. It was a hard lesson, but it was
well-learned. The site is built on a yaml config file that describes
the nested navigation list you see here.

I wrote a function to go through the data recursively, giving everything
a unique ID and other tweaks to make it a useful state, then renders it
using a recursive component.

The site then uses .MDX files to render each project page, which allows
for easy editing without limiting customizability to just what markdown
allows.

Some issues I needed to deal with include:

- Rendering only the toggled list item
- Dynamically loading MDX files as components based on Route
- Getting a handle on using git
- Learning React (yes I learned React mostly to build
  a portfolio in it, but also to be more hireable)
