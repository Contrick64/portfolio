# Irene H. Clark, Navajo Master Weaver

[https://vimeo.com/495208688](https://vimeo.com/495208688)

This is a documentary I made while in school
at Fitchburg State. We (a 4-person crew) flew
out to the Navajo nation, and spent 10 days
interviewing and filming the Clark family, and
especially Irene's dyeing and weaving process.

My role was Director of Photography, but in such
a small crew, we all took on various overlapping
roles. I also contributed to the visual design of
the film, as well as the music, themes, and final
feeling in the edit.
