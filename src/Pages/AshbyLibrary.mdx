# Ashby Library Wayfinding Signs
---

In my time at the Ashby Library, I did my best to help
improve our patrons' experience with the collection, from
working on the system of shelving and organizing, to making
sure that every book's markings were notated in the database.

My favorite project I worked on was this:

<Image src={shelfEndImg} className='w-75 mx-auto' />

These signs were designed to help patron's find what they
were looking for with as little trouble as possible. The
brief was being able to quickly orient yourself at a glance,
and to unify the signage into one cohesive system.

I designed a map as well, with each of the sections labeled
and color coded. It also prominently displays all exits with
a recognizable green icon.
