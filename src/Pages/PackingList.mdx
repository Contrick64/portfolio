# _Packing List_ Radio Show Identity

<hr />

This is a project I worked on while at Fitchburg State for my radio show
on WXPL 91.3

The show was based on the BBC Radio show _Desert Island Discs_, which
asked people about the music they'd bring to a desert island. In my case,
I structured the show by asking for 5 desert island picks.

In the show's identity, I wanted to evoke 60s and 70s psychedelia
because of its strong ties to music nostalgia in general.
