# _Packing List_ Radio Show Identity

<hr />

This is a project I worked on while at Fitchburg State for my radio show
on WXPL 91.3

The show was based on the BBC Radio show _Desert Island Discs_, which
asked people about the music they'd bring to a desert island. In my case,
I structured the show by asking for 5 desert island picks.

In the show's identity, I wanted to evoke 60s and 70s psychedelia
because of its strong ties to music nostalgia in general.

Many of the Packing List posters were silly Photoshops relating to names
or albums. This poster uses the illustration from the cover of the band
Bowling Shoes' first release. Also included on this poster is the typeface
and wordmark used in the banner, which became a unified visual identity of
the show.

The posters were designed to be posted on Facebook, so the square dimensions
were chosen to maximize readability and clarity for that platform. On the left
are some of the more free form designs from season one of the show, with season
two on the right. In season two I began to standardize the use of the logo. I
used these posters to explore design and illustration, and attempt a lot of
things I hadn't before, which is always something I look for in design projects.
