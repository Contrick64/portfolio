# SAPA TV Website

This is a website I made for SAPA TV in Springfield,
VT. I was contracted to make them a site using WordPress,
which required a custom PHP theme. It also required a
homepage with a media player and schedule, which I scraped
from their oddly configured streaming server.

As you can see, I like to keep my projects streamlined and
clean. I think the most important part of a website, and
frankly any design, is readability. I paid close attention
to accessibility, typographic flow, and ease of use for both
the end user and the editors.
