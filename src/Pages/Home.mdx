### Skills and Competencies

<Skills variant='plain' />
</Container>

I have spent a lot of time learning all of these roles and skills,
working in each and every one of them in varying capacities. I
have professional experience as a librarian, graphic designer, web
designer, radio station general manager, and public access intern. The other roles I've listed
have been learned through countless hours of personal project work.
Some of that work is listed here on my website, so take a look around!
And shoot me an email if you have any questions.
