# Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I consider myself to be, first
and foremost, a **critical thinker** and a **problem solver**. However,
in my research to find what makes a good portfolio, I kept seeing the
advice: _"Make sure to prominently display your desired job title!"_

So here are a few, with my current interests/specializations bolded:

- **Frontend Developer**
- UI/UX/Print/**Web Designer**
- **Circulation / Cataloging Librarian**
- Public Access Television Production Coordinator
- Radio Board Operator
- Art Director
- Session Musician

I'm especially excited about working for **non-profits** and other
groups whose work focuses on helping people.

Here I've included some of my skills and competencies:

I have spent a lot of time learning all of these roles and skills,
working in each and every one of them in varying capacities. I
have professional experience as a librarian, graphic designer, web
designer, radio station general manager, and public access intern. The other roles I've listed
have been learned through countless hours of personal project work.
Some of that work is listed here on my website, so take a look around! And shoot me an email if you have any questions.
