# Hi, I'm Connor Murphy
---

<div className='ascii-feature float-left text-secondary p-2'>
  <AsciiCat />
</div>
Before I introduce myself, I'd like you to meet my ASCII art
cat, Morace. Try petting him!


I'm a **frontend developer** and **web designer**,
but I bring to the table a unique perspective informed
by a multitude of work experiences. I have worn quite a few
metaphorical hats, including creative roles in film, radio,
music, design, and most recently as a librarian. That said,
I must stress that _I do not actually wear hats._

{/* So here are a few, with my current specializations bolded:

- **Frontend Developer**
- UI/UX/Print/**Web Designer**
- **Circulation / Cataloging Librarian**
- Public Access Television Production Coordinator
- Radio Board Operator
- Art Director
- Session Musician */}

I'm looking to do high quality creative work for/with high quality
creative people. I'm especially excited about connecting with **non-profits**
and other groups whose work focuses on helping people.
