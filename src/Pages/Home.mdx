#### Designer, Artist, Developer, etc.

I wear many hats, and I put my all into everything I do.
You'd be hard pressed to find an interest I haven't at least
dipped my toes into. This website shows the things I've focused on
enough to be proud of, and my qualifications for finding jobs.

##### Here are a few of the roles I play or have played:

- Web Developer
  - React
  - PHP
  - HTML/(S)CSS/JS
  - Wordpress
  - MySQL
- Graphic Designer
  - Very familiar with most Adobe software, including
    AfterEffects
- Bassist/Composer/Conductor
- Radio Show Host
- Concert Booker
- Audio Technician
- Organizer
- Librarian

If you hire me, you won't regret it. I take my work seriously and,
try though I might for some of the more menial things I've done,
I will care deeply about the work I am doing, and apply critical
thinking to the task at hand.

Thank you for your time, and I welcome any feedback you may have!
