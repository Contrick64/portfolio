# Welcome!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! In my research to find
what makes a good portfolio, I found that everyone seems to say
_"Make sure to prominently display your desired job title!"_

So here are a few:

- Frontend Developer
- UI/UX Designer
- Print Designer
- Web Designer
- Project Manager
- Circulation / Cataloging Librarian
- Public Access Production Coordinator
- Radio Board Operator
- Art Director
- Session Musician

I have spent a lot of time learning all of these roles, working in
each and every one of them in varying capacities. I have
professional experience as a librarian, graphic designer, web
designer and public access intern. The other roles I've listed
have been learned through countless hours of personal project work.
Some of that work is listed here on my website, so take a look around! And shoot me an email if you have any questions.
