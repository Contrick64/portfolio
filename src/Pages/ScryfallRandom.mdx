# Scryfall Random Card Fetcher

This is a tool I built to help fetch random cards from the
[Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api). I use Scryfall's
website frequently while building
<attr title="Magic: The Gathering">MTG</attr> decks,
especially for the <attr title="Elder Dragon Highlander">EDH</attr>,
aka Commander, format. I wasn't happy with the site's interface
for retrieving random cards based on a search query, so I made
my own!
